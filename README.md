## `theMatrix` is a simple, text based, "share a bill app"

- Not every payment has to be done with all persons involved.
- Every participant of a payment can decide to 
  - not contribute to it with a zero amount,
  - contribute to it with a positive amount,
  - contribute to it with a negative amount.


Running `theMatrix` results with first command line argument `input.csv` 

https://github.com/PSBP-Library/theMatrix/blob/main/input.csv

and second command line argument `output.csv` (assuming non-existent) creates `output.csv`

https://github.com/PSBP-Library/theMatrix/blob/main/output.csv.



To use `theMatrix` yourself use your own csv files.
